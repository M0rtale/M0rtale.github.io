                <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hey there! I am <em>nikobelic29</em>, and I specialize in DevOps, focusing heavily
                    on deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. My passion lies in creating scalable and
                    efficient infrastructure that supports the applications and services I build.
                </p>

                <h3>What Do I Do?</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m working on building a collection of API endpoints that will run on my 
                    Kubernetes clusters. The goal is to make all my services available and functional across 
                    my infrastructure. While not everything is perfect yet, I'm always striving to improve 
                    performance and availability.
                </p>

                <h3>Current Focus</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kubernetes Deployment:</strong> I manage and deploy Kubernetes clusters that host my various projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>API Development:</strong> My ongoing mission is to write a series of API endpoints and deploy them, ensuring that all my services are connected and somewhat accessible.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Want to Know More?</h3>
                <p>
                    For a deeper dive into my infrastructure setup and how everything connects, check out my
                    <strong>Inframap</strong> page. There, you’ll find a visual map of my infrastructure and details 
                    about my current projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also document my progress and past work in the <strong>Projects</strong> section, so feel free to 
                    explore and see what I’ve been up to!
